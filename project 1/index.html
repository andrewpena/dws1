				<h2>THE ALL-NEW 2014 CORVETTE STINGRAY COUPE</h2>
				<p><strong>“Precision”</strong> isn’t just a word. For the designers
				of the all-new 2014 Corvette Stingray, it was a mantra.
				Throwing off the constraints of tradition, our world-class
				engineers started over from scratch to build a revolutionary
				lightweight vehicle with the aesthetic impact and the performance
				prowess worthy of the Stingray emblem.</p>

				<h3>Designed On Purpose</h3>
                	<p>Provocative, purposeful and sculpted for optimal performance, 
                	the all-new <em>Stingray Coupe</em> is low, light and lean. Increased 
                	downforce keeps the vehicle planted, while its functional exterior 
                	vents create a totally new breathing experience to reduce lift and 
                	minimize drag. The advanced ventilation systems help air flow from 
                    front to back, cooling critical components of the perfectly balanced 
                    powertrain. This efficient airflow controls temperatures and improves 
                    vehicle handling. Stunning design, meet racing strategy.</p>
                <h3>Hood Extractor</h3>
					<p>This is no bottom breather. A functional hood air extractor 
					directs air from the front grille up through the forward-tilted 
					radiator and out of the engine compartment. Each blade is 
					precisely angled for optimal airflow. The result is reduced 
					front-end lift, increased downforce and improved handling 
					at high speeds.</p>
				<h3>Brake cooling</h3>
                    <p>The available Z51 Performance Package includes dual brake 
                    ducts that transport air from the front grille through the 
                    wheel-wells to effectively cool front brakes and expel heat. 
                    This efficient airflow controls temperature, reduces brake 
                    fade and optimizes stopping performance.</p>
                <h3>Power-train Cooling</h3>
					<p>Dual rear quarter panel intake vents, also included with the 
					Z51 package, guide airflow to cool two separate heat exchangers. 
					One routes air to the transmission oil cooler. The other cools 
					the rear differential. Air escapes through tailored rear taillamp 
					vents and lower-rear fascia outlets. This system was adapted 
					from Corvette Racing to reduce temperatures during 
					high-performance driving.</p>

				<h3>The Journey Begins In The Cockpit</h3>
					<p>Illuminated by innovative digital features and intelligent 
					driver controls, the Stingray cockpit is a stunning change from 
					your typical interior scenery. An ingenious available color 
					Head-Up Display complements the customizable dual display 
					featuring two 8-inch screens. A sweeping freeform line spans 
					the instrument panel and flawlessly carries over into the door 
					trim and console. And every inch is imbued with a deep respect 
					for authentic materials. Real aluminum. Available carbon fiber. 
					Grade A leather hand-selected and crafted to adorn a new 
					generation of elegance.</p>
				<h3>Authentic Materials</h3>
					<p>Nappa leather, available on the 3LT trim level is a 
					testament to the honest, crafted interior of the 
					all-new Stingray. Free from imperfections and soft to 
					the touch, its smooth, natural grain dismisses the notion 
					of synthetic textures. The 3LT package also includes a 
					hand-stretched, leather-wrapped instrument panel swathed 
					and sewn to meticulous fit and finish while lightweight 
					aluminum accents adorn the doors, pedals, shifter and 
					cockpit instrumentation.</p>
				<h3>The Instrument Panel Of The Future</h3>
					<p>The intuitive instrument cluster bears an 8-inch diagonal 
					high-definition screen with reconfigurable gauges and real-time 
					performance data. The center console entertainment interface 
					features a retractable, tablet-inspired touch-screen complete 
					with customizable apps. And an available color Head-Up Display 
					projects critical data into the driver’s line of sight 
					on the windshield.</p>
				<h3>Steering Wheel</h3>
      				<p>Designed exclusively for Stingray and hand-wrapped in natural 
      				leather (or sueded microfiber if you choose the Competition 
      				Sport seats), a smaller, race-inspired steering wheel enhances 
      				grip and driving feel. A discreet, flat euro-stitch lends a 
      				subtle but crafted feel. Steering wheel-mounted paddles initiate 
      				Active Rev Matching on the manual transmission or manual shifting 
      				on the automatic transmission.</p>

				<h3>Lighter, More Rigid, More Precise</h3>
					<p>Lean materials and efficient new processes forge the light, 
					stiff Stingray space frame, which helps achieve a near 50-50 
					weight distribution and impressive power-to-weight ratio. 
					One-third the weight of steel, aluminum improves rigidity, 
					which in turn enhances cornering and handling. Lightweight 
					Carbon-Nano Composite underbody panels bond to aluminum, 
					further reducing weight for more precise driver control. 
					This revolutionary chassis improves torsional rigidity, 
					reducing noise and elevating performance to an art.</p>
				<h3>Lighter Frame</h3>
					<p>One-third the weight of steel, the Stingray aluminum space 
					frame is 100 pounds (45 kilograms) lighter than its predecessor.</p>
				<h3>Aluminum Segments</h3>
					<p>Segmented aluminum rails — varying in thickness from 2 mm 
					to 11 mm — enable tailored gauge, shape and strength properties 
					with minimal weight.</p>
				<h3>Stiffer Than Steel</h3>
					<p>The all-aluminum Stingray space frame assembly, used on both 
					coupe and convertible, is also 57 % stiffer than its steel predecessor.</p>
				<h3>Fastest-Acting Suspension</h3>
					<p><q>Stingray incorporates the world’s fastest-acting suspension.</q> 
					Magnetic Selective Ride Control™ is an available real-time 
					damping system that “reads” the road every millisecond and 
					can adjust in under 15 milliseconds. Available on the Z51 
					Performance and Handling Package, Magnetic Ride includes 
					Performance Traction Management, which features five settings 
					tailored to driver skill level and track conditions.</p>
