			<p>Hawk is a common name for some small to medium-sized <em>Diurnal birds of prey</em>,
			widely distributed and varying greatly in size. The subfamily <strong>Accipitrinae</strong>
			includes goshawks, sparrowhawks, the sharp-shinned hawk and others. These are
			mainly woodland birds with long tails and high visual acuity, hunting by sudden 
			dashes from a concealed perch. In the Americas, members of the Buteo group are 
			also called hawks; these are called buzzards in other parts of the world. Generally 
			buteos have broad wings and sturdy builds. They are relatively larger winged, 
			shorter-tailed and soar more extensively in open areas than accipiters, 
			descending or pouncing on their prey rather than making fast horizontal pursuit. 
			The terms buteonine hawk and accipitrine hawk may be used to distinguish the 
			two types, in regions where hawk applies to both. The term "true hawk" 
			(with scare quotes) is sometimes used for the accipitrine hawks, in regions 
			where buzzard is preferred for the buteonine hawks. All these groups are members 
			of the Accipitridae family, which includes the hawks and buzzards as well as kites, 
			harriers and eagles. Some authors use "hawk" generally for any small to medium 
			Accipitrid that is not an eagle. Immature Northern goshawk with fresh kill Hawk 
			sighted in Toronto in front of the Fields Institute. The common names of some birds 
			include the term "hawk", reflecting traditional usage rather than taxonomy, 
			such as referring to an osprey as a "fish hawk" or a peregrine falcon as a "duck hawk".</p>

		<h3>Intelligence</h3>
            <p>In February 2005, the Canadian ornithologist Louis Lefebvre announced 
            a method of measuring avian "IQ" in terms of their innovation in feeding 
            habits. Hawks were named among the most intelligent birds based on his scale.</p>

            <div id='content2'>
        <h3>Eyesight</h3>
			<p>Hawks have four types of colour receptors in the eye. These give birds 
			the ability to perceive not only the visible range but also the ultraviolet 
			part of the spectrum, and other adaptations allow for the detection of 
			polarised light or magnetic fields. This is due to the many photoreceptors 
			in the retina (up to 1,000,000 per square mm for Buteo, against 200,000 for humans), 
			an exceptional number of nerves connecting these receptors to the brain, 
			and an indented fovea, which magnifies the central portion of the visual field.</p>
			</div>
		<h2 id='migration'>Migration</h2>
			<p>Like most birds, the hawk migrates in the autumn and the spring. Different types 
			of hawks choose separate times in both of the seasons to migrate north or south. 
			The entire autumn migrating season extends all the way from August to half way 
			through December. It has been studied that there are longer migration distances 
			than others. The long-distance travelers tend to begin in early autumn while the 
			short distance travelers start much later. Thus, the longer the distance the earlier 
			the bird begins its journey. There have also been a few studies on the relevance of 
			the speed and efficiency of the bird's migration. It is better for a hawk to 
			arrive at its destination as early as possible. This is because the first bird to 
			a new area has the first pick of mates, living area, food, and much more necessities 
			for survival. The more fat a bird has when it starts its migration, the better chance 
			it has of making the trip safely. Kerlinger states that studies have shown that a bird 
			has more body fat when it begins its migration, before it leaves, than when it is 
			finished with its travels and has arrived at its destination. One of the most important 
			parts of the hawk's migration is the flight direction because the direction or path the 
			bird chooses to take could greatly affect its migration. The force of wind is a large 
			variable because it could either throw the bird off course or push it in the right direction, 
			depending on the direction of the wind.[10] To ensure a safer journey, a hawk tries to avoid 
			any large bodies of water in the spring and fall by detouring around a lake or flying along 
			a border.</p> 
		<h2 id='behavior'>Behavior</h2>
			<p>Starting in the hawk's early life, the bird is fed by its parents until it leaves 
			the nest for good. The young hawk, while still in its fledgling phase, will leave 
			its nest as early as six weeks old. Once the bird is older it begins its ancestral 
			instinct to hunt. The hawk makes kills of its prospective meals with its claws as 
			opposed to other predator birds such as the falcon. The falcon uses its claws to catch 
			the prey but kills the small animal with its mouth instead of its claws, like the hawk. 
			The hawk's preferred time for hunting is usually just before nightfall when the daylight 
			begins to lessen. Although the hawk is known for being a violent predator, some are 
			gentle and quiet. The hawk's main way of transportation is flying. When it flies, 
			the hawk flaps its wings rapidly, and then uses that momentum to glide smoothly and 
			gracefully through the air. The idea of flocking during migration has been closely analyzed, 
			and there is a conclusion that it is a commutative tool used by birds and other animals to 
			increase survival. It has become very clear to observers that a bird traveling in a flock 
			has a greater chance of survival than if it made the journey alone. Another word used in 
			the United States that has the same meaning as "flock," particularly in terms of groups of 
			hawks, is "kettle."</p>
		<h2 id='reproduction'>Reproduction</h2>
			<p>Hawks have been known for their mating season. The method this animal uses to reproduce 
			is different from most. The male and female will fly together up in the air in a circular 
			motion. Once the two get to a certain height, the male will dive toward the female and then 
			they will raise back to the height again. The two birds will repeat this until finally the 
			male latches onto the female and they begin to free-fall down to earth. In one year, a female 
			hawk will lay about five eggs. Both the male and the female will cater and take care of the 
			eggs for about a month until they hatch. The male and the female will also create their 
			nest before the mating season and will improve it together during the nesting season. The 
			two birds usually make their nest prior to mating. Some species of hawks tend to be monogamous, 
			staying with the same mating partner their whole lives.</p>
